# DataQuest Project 16: Predicting Car Prices With the K-Nearest Neighbors Algorithm

This is the 16th project I completed in the "Data Analyst in Python" and "Data Scientist in Python" paths from Dataquest. In this project a dataset containing different attributes of previously sold cars will be used to make predictions on the sale price of other cars. The machine learning model that will be used is the k-nearest neighbors model.

The educational goal of the project is to use the scikit-learn module to construct a k-nearest neighbors model and then to analyze its efficacy at predicting the price of cars.

## Prerequisites

This project requires both the Jupyter notebook as well as the `data` file containing data on previous car sales.

To run this project, you will need `Jupyter Notebooks` with a python 3 kernel to be installed on your machine. Instructions on how to install `Jupyter Notebooks` can be found on the [Jupyter website](https://jupyter.org/install).

The project itself is written in Python 3 and uses the modules `Numpy`, `matplotlib`, `sklearn`, `seaborn` and `Pandas`, ` to run. These can be installed by running `pip install <name of module>` in the console.
